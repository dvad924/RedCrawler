  <h2>DV-MG-IR-csi550 WebCrawler</h2>
  <p>This is a school project for ICSI 550 Information Retrieval 
  at the University at Albany. The intention of this webcrawler 
  is to learn about modern search engines, a major factor being 
  a webcrawler to retrieve raw html data.</p>

  <p>
    The challenge of this particular crawler is to identify and store only:
    the links themselves, the titles of the posts, the major TEXT content
    of a post if there exists any, and the comments on the post. This is done
    with the hope of being able to index and then search on not only the 
    post titles but the comments and the content of the posts as well.
  </p>
  <p> In attempt not to bother reddit admins, the requests have been set to 
    send no more than 12 requests per minute. </p>
